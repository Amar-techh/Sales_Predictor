# Sales_Predictor
​📈 Sales Prediction Model (SVR)
​This repository contains a machine learning solution for predicting sales using Support Vector Regression (SVR). The model is designed to capture non-linear patterns in sales data, achieving a high degree of predictive accuracy.
​🏆 Model Performance
​Algorithm: Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
​Accuracy: 0.88 R^2 Score
​Kernel: RBF (Radial Basis Function)
​🛠️ Key Features
​End-to-End Pipeline: Integrated data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling.
​Standardized Scaling: Full implementation of StandardScaler to optimize SVR distance-based learning.
​Categorical Handling: Professional encoding of categorical variables to ensure compatibility with numerical solvers.
​Robustness: Handled missing values and potential outliers to stabilize the R^2 score at 0.88.
